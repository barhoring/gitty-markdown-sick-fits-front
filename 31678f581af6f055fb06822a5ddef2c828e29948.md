The way the we're going to work is to have 2 windows of VS Code - frontend & backend.
Install the recommended extensions.

Run `npm i` on both projects.
Ignore any npm WARN during the installation - it's a part of working with npm. It's best to follow along with the pinned versions on `package.json`
